# Python_Bootcamp_Blackjack
Solution for the Milestone 2 Project - building a blackjack game according to modified rules (face cards are worth 10, aces' value are chosen by the player)

I created this solution based on the requirements spelled [here](https://github.com/Frankie-Ciancy/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp/blob/master/08-Milestone%20Project%20-%202/01-Milestone%20Project%202%20-%20Assignment.ipynb) and some more game-specific explanation (e.g card value) explained in the course video. 

#TODO: expand game to include multiple players
#TODO: practice line comprehensions
